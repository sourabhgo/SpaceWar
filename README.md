# SpaceWar


Spacewar - A complete version of the Spacewar game. Demonstrates most of the game programming aspects from previous repositories.

Spacewar is a two-player game that runs on a single computer. Each player will have one spaceship he or she controls using either keyboard or game controller inputs. Each ship will have one torpedo that it may fire. A firing delay will be used to prevent more than one torpedo per ship from being active at the same time. The torpedo will damage the other ship with a direct hit. The torpedo will not damage its own ship. A planet in the center of the screen will have mass and gravitational attraction of the ships and torpedoes. Collision detection between the ships, the planet, and the enemy torpedo will be supported. The game will also include sounds for collisions and explosions. A player is awarded one point when the other ship is destroyed in any way, including accidental crashes into the planet.Each playerâ€™s score will be displayed.
